The file Z_AMS_NETWEAVER_MONITORING.SAP is an authorisation role for RFC metric extraction from SAP Netweaver or S/4HANA systems for use with the Azure Monitor for SAP (AMS) v2.0.
Micorostf keep losing the link, so I've put the role here fore safekeeping.
If/when Microsoft update the tool and change the role requirements, then I may need to update this role, but there's no guarantee it is 100% correct.
